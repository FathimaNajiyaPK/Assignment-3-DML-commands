# Assignment-3-DML-commands
In this assignment, we focused on performing key Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations using the `Managers` table. 
The table was designed with various fields like `Manager_Id`, `First_name`, `Last_Name`, `DOB`, `Age`, `Last_update`, `Gender`,
`Department`, and `Salary`, with proper constraints such as a **CHECK** constraint on `Age` and **NOT NULL** for `Salary`. 

The following tasks were accomplished:

1. **Inserted 10 rows of data** representing different managers with their respective details.
2. **Retrieved specific data** like the name and date of birth for the manager with a specific `Manager_Id`.
3. **Calculated the annual income** for all managers by multiplying their monthly salary by 12.
4. **Filtered records** to display all managers except one specific manager (`Aaliya`).
5. **Filtered managers** based on their department (`IT`) and salary (greater than 25,000 per month).
6. **Displayed details** of managers whose salary falls within a specified range (between 10,000 and 35,000 per month).
